        Drones have been a huge fight to some for a long time.  Some believe that they feel like they're being spied on and want to limit the use of them for both
        businesses and personal use. There are already laws for peeping toms and for flying things in general.<br /><br />
        One case of this happened in Seattle, where a drone pilot was contracted to get pictures to help the contractor build a new skyline.<br /><br />
        A lady called the cops after spotting the drone while changing.  She was scared that people have the ability to do this now.  The pilot did claim
        that there were no topless pictures, but also assured that this won't really be a problem unless he had the drone a lot closer than where he had it.<br /><br />
        The cameras on the drones have weak lenses and are only really used for hobbies if it's used personally but businesses use them for planning big projects like constuction.
