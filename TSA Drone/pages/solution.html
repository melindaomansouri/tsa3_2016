        There are many point of views on "drones" and if they should be restricted by where they are operated and what they are viewing. Privacy should be respected and with the way that they are being used right now should be restricted. “I think the two big issues for aerial robots in particular are safety and privacy…you have any aviation risk when you have something flying around in the air that could go out of control and land in a way that is not desired.” said Mark Yong CEO & Founder of Garuda Robotics.<br /> A drone cannot weigh more than 55lbs, imagine that falling out of the sky because someone lost control of their drone. The FFA is proposing rules on limiting how high, fast and how much they would need to weigh for pilotless drones.<br />
        We believe that what the FFA has proposed is a good solution for this current situation. The uses of drones in America should be used wisely and people are going to abuse that then we need limitations. Other limits that we think should be thought about are, removing cameras off of personal drones for the public and leave the monitoring to the law enforcement and government.
