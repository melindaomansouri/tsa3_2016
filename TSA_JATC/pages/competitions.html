				<br />
			<p>-Fashion Design: Participants (three teams of two to four individuals per state) research, develop, and create garment designs, garment mockups, and portfolios that reflect the current year’s published theme. Semifinalists participate in an on-site event in which they present their garment designs to judges.</p>
				<br />
			<p>-Flight Endurance: Participants (two individuals per chapter, one entry per individual) analyze flight principles with a rubber band-powered model aircraft.</p>
				<br />
			<p>-Future Technology Teacher: Participants (three individuals per chapter) research and select three accredited colleges or universities that offer technology education teacher preparation as a major.
