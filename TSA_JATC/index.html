		<h4>The Technology Student Association's Motto:</h4>
			<p>-Learning To Live In A Technical World.</p>
				<br />
		<h4>The Technology Student Association's Creed:</h4>
			<p>-I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of mu hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of mu ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans. </p>
				<br />
		<h4>History Of TSA:</h4>
			<p>-The Technology Student Association (TSA), formerly AIASA, is the oldest student organization dedicated exclusively to students enrolled in technology education classes grades K-12. It has a rich history that spans nearly four decades. Three distinct periods may be found in TSA's history. During the period from 1958 to 1978, the American Industrial Arts Student Association (AIASA) was a sponsored activity of the American Industrial Arts Association (AIAA). In 1978, the nonprofit corporation, AIASA, Inc., was formed to oversee AIASA as a separate organization. During the decade that followed, the organization grew in size, strength, structure, and impact on students and secondary school programs. The summer of 1988 closed this third decade as AIASA reached another milestone, a change in the organization's name: the Technology Student Association (TSA).</p>

        <h4>Competitions:</h4>
        <p>-Animatronics: Participants (one team per chapter, one entry per team) demonstrate knowledge of mechanical and control systems by designing, fabricating, and controlling an animatronics device that will communicate, entertain, inform, demonstrate and/or illustrate a topic, idea, subject or concept. Sound, lights and a surrounding environment must accompany the device.</p>
        <br />
        <p>-Architectural Renovation: Participants (one individual or team per chapter, one entry per individual or team) develop a set of architectural plans and related materials for an annual architectural design challenge and construct a physical, as well as a computer-generated model, to accurately depict their design.</p>
        <br />
        <p>-Biotechnology Design: Participants (three teams of two to six individuals per state, one entry per team) select a contemporary biotechnology problem (that relates to the current year’s published area of focus) and demonstrate understanding of it through documented research, the development of a solution, a display, and an effective multimedia presentation.</p>
        <br />
        <p>-Career Preparation:  Participants (six individuals per state) research technology-related careers designated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as falling in the top ten employment growth areas in the near future. As part of the research for the careers noted in the current conference year,students prepare a resume and cover letter for each career. Semifinalists participate in an on-site job interview related to one of the careers.</p>
        <br />
        <p>-Chapter Team: Participants (one team of six individuals per chapter) take a written parliamentary procedures test in order to qualify for the semifinalist level of competition. Semifinalist teams perform an opening ceremony, dispose of three items of business, and perform a closing ceremony within a specified time period.</p>
        <br />
        <p>-Children’s Stories: Participants (one team per chapter; a team of one individual is permitted) create an illustrated children's story of artistic, instructional, and social value. The story must have a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) focus. It may be written in prose or poetry and take the form of a fable, adventure story, or other structure.</p>
