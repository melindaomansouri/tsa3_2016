		<h4>The Technology Student Association's Motto:</h4>
			<p>-Learning To Live In A Technical World.</p>
				<br />
		<h4>The Technology Student Association's Creed:</h4>
			<p>-I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of mu hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of mu ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans. </p>

		<h4>History Of TSA:</h4>
			<p>-The Technology Student Association (TSA), formerly AIASA, is the oldest student organization dedicated exclusively to students enrolled in technology education classes grades K-12. It has a rich history that spans nearly four decades. Three distinct periods may be found in TSA's history. During the period from 1958 to 1978, the American Industrial Arts Student Association (AIASA) was a sponsored activity of the American Industrial Arts Association (AIAA). In 1978, the nonprofit corporation, AIASA, Inc., was formed to oversee AIASA as a separate organization. During the decade that followed, the organization grew in size, strength, structure, and impact on students and secondary school programs. The summer of 1988 closed this third decade as AIASA reached another milestone, a change in the organization's name: the Technology Student Association (TSA).</p>
